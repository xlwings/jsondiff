    """
    Extends CompactJsonDiffSyntax to focus exclusively on the right (modified) values for lists,
    suitable for scenarios where only the latest state matters, ignoring the specific changes that led there.
    Compare to the CompactJsonDiffSyntax, I will not compare the difference in list,
    because in some senario we only care about the right value (in most cases means latest value).
    Instead, I will pop the later list value.

    Example:
        Given two JSON structures, `a` and `b`:

        a = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "skills": ["Python", "Django"]}
        b = {"name": "Alice", "age": 31, "skills": ["Python", "Django", "Flask"]}

        The `emit_dict_diff` method would produce a diff focusing on the updated and added fields:

        {
            "age": 31,
            "skills": ["Python", "Django", "Flask"]
        }

        And the `emit_list_diff` method directly returns the modified list without detailing the individual changes:

        ["Python", "Django", "Flask"]

        This approach simplifies the diff when the path from `a` to `b` is not as relevant as the final state represented by `b`.
